Created basic blue microphone icon using the free version of Iconion
(http://iconion.com/); used custom sizes of 19x19 and 38x38.

This produced an icon with too much white space around it for use at
small size so manually produced 38x38 from 128x128 by cropping then
resizing using http://resizeimage.net/.  Did not bother with doing this
for 16x16 or 19x19.
